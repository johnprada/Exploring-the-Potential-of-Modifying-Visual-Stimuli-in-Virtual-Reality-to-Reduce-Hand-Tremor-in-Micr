# Exploring-the-Potential-of-Modifying-Visual-Stimuli-in-Virtual-Reality-to-Reduce-Hand-Tremor-in-Micr
Involuntary tremor is a serious challenge in micromanipulation tasks. For delicate micromanipulation, 
subjects need to perform tasks while effectively minimizing their hand tremor. 
We tried to increase subjectsâ€™ self-awareness of hand tremor to reduce tremor, 
by employing virtual reality (VR) technology. We propose a VR-based system that
reconstructs an image of a handheld gripper with emphasized hand tremor. 
Provided with this modified visual feedback, we hypothesize that subjects will
develop better self-awareness of the tremor and thus control it more effectively. 
Two methods for visual modification are demonstrated to emphasize the hand tremor in VR:
(1) tremor amplification and (2) object size magnification, in comparison to a control 
condition without any modifications. A human-subject study with twelve trials was conducted,
using four healthy participants who performed a task based on minimizing hand tremor whil
e holding the gripper in a certain direction. The results showed that the two proposed visual modification
methods achieved reduced hand tremor compared with the control condition.
